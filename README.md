# VPTP - Vehicle Penetration Testing Platform

## Description
VPTP (Vehicle Penetration Testing Platform) is intended to be a platform designed for quick-turnaround times in testing vehicle systems given a known set security vulnerabilities. It's original intention is to be a wrapper OS, built on the commonly known Kali Linux distribution, which already includes some of the most popular penetration testing tools:

- Metasploit
- Nmap
- Wireshark
- Aircrack-ng
- John the Ripper
- etc.

The original platform is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi 5 Model B, but should be able to be run on any hardware that can run Kali Linux. Details of the hardware used to develop the platform are included in the [Hardware](./hardware/hardware.md) documentation.
